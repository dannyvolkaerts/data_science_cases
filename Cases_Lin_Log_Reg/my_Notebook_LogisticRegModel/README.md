Logistic Regression Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on performing logistic regression analysis to predict medical outcomes using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Additionally, comparisons with other classification models are provided.

Data Acquisition:
The dataset is downloaded using the Kaggle API.
Dataset: “Appendix Cancer Prediction Dataset”.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Viewing the first few rows of the dataset.
Inspecting the structure, data types, and summary statistics.
Checking for missing values and addressing them accordingly.

Data Preprocessing:
Standardization using StandardScaler.
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

Model Training:
Logistic Regression using LogisticRegression from sklearn.

Comparison with alternative models such as:
Lasso Regression.
Ridge Classifier.
Random Forest Classifier.

Metrics evaluated include:
Accuracy Score.
Classification Report.
Confusion Matrix.
Visualizations generated for better understanding of results.

Logistic Regression Performance:
Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on both training and test sets.
Classification Report: Showed strong performance across key metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
Confusion Matrix: Visualized to highlight model predictions.

Comparison with Other Models:
Random Forest Classifier, Ridge Classifier, and Lasso Regression were tested.
All the models shows the same accuracy rate of 84.90%
