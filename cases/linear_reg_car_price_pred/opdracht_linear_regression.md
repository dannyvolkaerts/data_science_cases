I completed this task from step 1 to the end in my own way, without
using the original notebook.

\* Importing required libraries

\* Updating global settings

\* Loading the dataset

\* Creating the copy of dataset

\* Info and describe the dataset

\* Checking duplicated rows

\* Drop duplicated rows

\* Extracting the car age from "year" column

\* Drop "name" and "year" columns

\* Removing any non-numeriec characters from "max_power" column to get
numeric column

\* Computing the number of bins for histogram of "selling_price" by
Square Root Rule

\* Histogram of "selling_price"

\* Histogram of numerical columns of dataset

\* Checking missing values

\* Separating numerical and categorical columns

\* Correlation matrix for numerical columns

\* Log1 transformation of numerical columns

\* Pipeline for numerical columns

\* Pipeline for categorical columns

\* Combining numerical and categorical features into a single
ColumnTransformer

\* Defining models

\* Splitting data into train and test sets

\* Pipeline(preprocessor, model)

\* Fitting models

\* Computing train_score, test_score, mse (these 3 scores also are
computed in the original notebook, so I can compare them)

\* Computing rmse

\* GridSearch, MLflow

\* Model Perfomance Comparison plot

\* Model Perfomance for cross validation plot

\* Comparing my results with original results

\* Feature importance

\* Actual vs Predicted y_train (XGBoost) plot
